# Readme

## Acknoweldgements

Thanks for Prof. Yan for his advice and contribution.

## Known Issues

[ ] Poetry composer needs to be trained.

[ ] Sentiment analysis is in great lack of tagged data. Current work-around used a simple principle of tag-by-word-occurence, and thus please don't expect the performance of sentiment analysis.
