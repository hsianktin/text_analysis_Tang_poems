This repository is a realization of text analysis based on the introduction to mini project.
However, things got stuck when trying to realize w2v network.
There are two obstacles. First, initialize a large matrix is memory-expensive. I used Google's Colab to help training. But the memory still exceeds the limit. Second, I used the standard network and 1000 poems to iterate for 3000 steps. The outcome is still unpromising.
